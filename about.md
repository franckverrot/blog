Hello! My name is Franck Verrot and I am a seasoned software developer.

I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from a French Engineering School, [CPE Lyon](http://www.cpe.fr), with a specialization in Software Engineering and Network Engineering.

Having worked in many contexts (from small 2-people startups to large corposations) and on all the layers that compose modern software architectures (from the DevOps up to the front-end) - I honed my skills in:

* Building new products from the ground-up
* Maintaining and evolving legacy systems
* Leading teams of (sometimes distributed) developers
* Transforming business requirements into actionable roadmap items

You can contact me at `franck at verrot dot fr` or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franckverrot).
