Hello! My name is Franck Verrot and I am a senior software engineer.

I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from a French Engineering School, [CPE Lyon](http://www.cpe.fr), with a specialization in Software Engineering and Network Engineering.

Over the years, I worked in many different contexts (technical, cultural,
organizational), operated on a diverse set of technologies, and evolved into
different roles.

I know how to:
* Build new products from the ground-up
* Build strategies to make Engineering departments more efficient, focused on the right thing
* Design, maintain, and evolve distributed systems
* Lead diverse teams (both in terms of specialties and cultural backgrounds)
* Transforming business requirements into actionable roadmap items

I have a passion for Open Source and led / join a lot of Open Source projects.
Take a look at my [Portfolio](http://franck.verrot.fr/portfolio/) for a list of companies and projects I am part / have been part of.
