title: "Moving back to Jekyll"

This blog used to run [Octopress][octopress] and I blame myself for not
updating it as much as it should have been updated.

From now on, I'll try using a basic Jekyll/GH Pages setup. Permalinks
have been preserved, so I believe it can't be a bad move anyway.

As usual, finding subjects is going to be the tricky part, but I have
some topics I always wanted to cover. So... stay tuned? :-)
