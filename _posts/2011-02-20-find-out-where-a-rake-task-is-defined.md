title: Find out where a Rake task is defined

*TL;DR*
Rake > 0.8.7 has a handy `Rake::Task#locations` method that makes it
damn easy to know where a task is defined or enhanced.

During the last [LyonRb](http://lyonrb.fr) meetup we read a quite large
portion of Rake's source code. The idea was to find an easy way to determine
what file was defining/enhancing what task.

[Richard](http://twitter.com/richarkmichael) and I just opened Rake
0.8.7's source code (from our local machine's RVM directory) and started hacking a bit to have that feature...

Two days after I can tell you that you won't need to hack anything
because it's actually already implemented in Rake's master since [May 19th
2009 by Jim Weirich](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake).

It wasn't obvious to us as [Rake 0.8.7](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake)
has been released on... May 15th 2009!
