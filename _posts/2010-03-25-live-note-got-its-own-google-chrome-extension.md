Thanks to [Luciano (@lucianosb)](http://www.google.com/profiles/luciano.santabrigida#buzz) Live-Note has got its own Google Chrome Extension.


He even shot a video about it:

So I guess it's time for me to make Live-Note a real product by setting up a couple of tools like an issue tracker and a wiki (for the documentation).


Few figures I'm kinda proud of. Live-Note is today:

* 42 users
* 3700+ notes added to Google Wave. These waves/blips are completely yours, only you (and the robot) have access to it, so it's entirely private.
