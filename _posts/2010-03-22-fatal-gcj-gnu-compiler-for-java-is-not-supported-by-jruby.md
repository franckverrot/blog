title: Fatal GCJ GNU Compiler for Java is not supported by JRuby

If you ever encountered this when installing JRuby on Ubuntu:

`Fatal: GCJ (GNU Compiler for Java) is not supported by JRuby.`

Doing 

`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre `

could do the trick, given you've installed sun-java6's packages on your machine.

I hope it'll help.
